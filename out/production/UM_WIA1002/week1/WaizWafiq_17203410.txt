My name is Waiz Wafiq with matrix number, 17203410 . I am
majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this
subject. This is because I am expecting to learn a lot of new advanced topics
related to Programming.

I acquired A for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will do my best to be committed on exploring new
things related to this subject. Wish me luck!!!

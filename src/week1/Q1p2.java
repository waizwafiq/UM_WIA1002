Thursday, 19 March 2021.

        My name is Waiz Wafiq with matrix number, 17203410 . I am
        majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This is my first time taking the
        Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this
        subject. This is because I am expecting to learn a lot of new advanced topics
        related to Programming.

        I acquired A for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
        think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
        to do well in the subject, I will do my best to be committed on exploring new
        things related to this subject. Wish me luck!!!
